1)NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine. NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them

2)Create React App: npx create-react-app .

3)Run React App: npm start

4)Useful extensions:
    Material Icon Theme
    ES7+React/Redux/React-Native snippets
    Auto Import - ES6, TS, JSX, TSX

5)Project structure:
   Create index.html in public folder
   Create components folder in src 
   Create index.js in src
   Create App.jsx in src 
   Create index.css in src

6)Initial Setups:

    in index.html
        Add html boilerplate code
        type #root to create a div with id "root"

    in App.jsx
        type rafce to generate the following code:
                import React from 'react'

                const App = () => {
                return (
                    <div>App</div>
                )
                }

                export default App
        Since we are using React 18,we don't need to import React in line 1 of code,so we can delete it

    in index.js
        We need to need to link our app component with the div with id "root" in index.html file
        So we need to add the following code:
            import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
            import App from './App';

            const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
            //this also works -> root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector('#root'));

            root.render(
                <App />
            );
